      "description": "Galaxies are categorized as elliptical, spiral, or irregular. There are at least two trillion galaxies in the universe. Each galaxy is bound by gravity and consists of stars, dust, interstellar gas, and dark matter. They range in size from a few billion stars to one hundred trillion stars. The oldest and most distant observed galaxy is actually 32 billion light years from Earth and is located in the constellation Ursa Major."

      "description": "The hottest place in the universe is actually a cloud of gas surrounding a swarm of galaxies that are clustered together in the Virgo constellation. The temperature there reaches 300 million degrees Celsius. The cloud is believed to have been formed as a result of colliding galaxies going at speeds of 2,500 miles per second."

      "description": "Scientists used various methods to estimate its age. These included methods such as measuring the composition of matter and energy density in the universe. Scientists also studied the oldest objects in space to help calculate its age. For example, they measured the age of some of the oldest known stars since there is a set method of determining the life cycle of a star based on its mass."

      "description": "The rest of the universe is around 68% dark energy, and less than 5% of the universe is made up of what we would consider “normal” matter. This means that roughly 80% of the mass of the universe is made up of material we cannot see."

Jupiter and Saturn are gas giant planets, and Uranus and Neptune are ice giant planets. Pluto was declassified as a planet in August 2006. Sorry Pluto! In 2014, the hypothetical planet dubbed Planet Nine was discovered, but its existence has not yet been confirmed."

Jupiter’s mass is one thousandth that of the sun but 2.5 times the mass of all the planets in our solar system combined. Jupiter also boasts the largest moon in our solar system with its moon Ganymede."

        "description": "Red dwarf stars make up an estimated ¾ of all stars found in the Milky Way. The surface temperature of red dwarf stars is less than 4,000 Kelvin, and they have a very low luminosity and therefore cannot be easily seen. In fact, from Earth not one red dwarf star can be seen with the naked eye. Since they develop very slowly and are constant for trillions of years, there are actually no advanced stars of this type in our universe because our universe is too young!"

        "description": "This amounts to more than 14 months in space. This feat was accomplished by Valeri Polyakov, a Russian astronaut who stayed aboard the Mir space station from January 1994 to March 1995. When Polyakov retired he had over 678 cumulative days in space, and his combined space time was over 22 months."

        "imageUrl": "https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/cygx1_ill.jpg",
        "description": "Black holes are one of the deadliest things in the universe. They are formed when a star with a mass more than three times that of our sun dies and collapses onto itself after an explosion called a supernova. Black holes can siphon the gas out of stars until they vanish. They can even break apart and swallow planets."
